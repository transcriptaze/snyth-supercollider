# snyth-supercollider

Basic Supercollider plugin that implements the _snyth_ Jacobi ellipse oscillator. For a detailed description, 
user guide and examples, please see the parent repository [README](https://github.com/transcriptaze/snyth).

This is very much a work-in-progress and there honestly isn't much here other than a bare bones proof of concept
because most of the development effort is currently being focused on the WebAudio implementation. But like the 
PureData implementation, one of these days.....
